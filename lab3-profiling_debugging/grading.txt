General (turned in correctly):
I had specifically asked for you to include the file "vectors_new.cpp" so that I could look at the hand-optimized code, but you only have the one "vectors.cpp" file.

Optimization (code and commentary):
* the code in your "vectors.cpp" file includes no hand optimization
* good commentary, though you provided insufficient code to back up these claims.

Debugging:
* correctly debugged
