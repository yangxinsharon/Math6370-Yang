Comments on performance:
* I would have liked a bit more understanding of the performance
  differences.  I'll note that you are the one storing things, so
  this has nothing to do with C++ vs Fortran, row-major vs
  column-major, ordering. [hint: this has to do with loading
  memory into cache].

Files:
* vec2d_b.cpp:
  - lines 100-103, 114-117, 132-135, 146-149, etc: with the flattened
    data array, these loops would be marginally more efficient if you
    used a single "for (long int i=0; i<(this->nrow)*(this->ncol); i++)"
    loop.
