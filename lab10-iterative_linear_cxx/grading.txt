Test results:
* Good analysis of your results.  I'm somewhat surprised that the non-blocking
  speedup was not better than the blocking (it was with other students), but
  this could just be natural variation from run to run.

Comments on your linresid_mpi_async routine:
* I would prefer if you'd add your name to the author list when you modify my code.

* You overcomplicated this.  Since neither MPI_Isend nor MPI_Irecv are blocking,
  you do not need to retain our previous multi-phase approach.  Instead, all procs
  can launch their MPI_Irecv and MPI_Isend calls at first, and then MPI_Wait for
  these to complete before using the message data.

* The whole point with MPI_Isend and MPI_Irecv is that you can do other useful work
  while the communications proceed, **before** you MPI_Wait on those messages to
  complete.  Instead, you MPI_Wait immediately after each call, effectively reducing
  these to blocking MPI_Send and MPI_Recv calls.
